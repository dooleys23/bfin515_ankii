Rule 1	'There is no such thing as a free dinner', every decision has a cost	
One decision has a cost and impact to another path is rule _&nbsp;	1	
<div>Building a school/education is free to students, but taxpayers pickup the check on paying salary, building school, upkeep, etc. is rule _</div><div><br /></div>	1	
Rule 2:	<div>2. INDIVIDUALS CHOOSE PURPOSEFULLY—THEY TRY TO GET THE MOST FROM</div><div>THEIR LIMITED RESOURCES</div>	
When choices are equal in cost, people will choose the most beneficial choice.<div>This is rule _</div>	2	
<div>People try not to squander their valuable resources</div><div>deliberately. Instead, they try to choose the options that best advance their personal</div><div>desires and goals at the least possible cost.</div><div><br /></div><div>This is rule:</div>	2	
Economizing behavior defines rule _	2

What is marginal decision making?	<div>When making a choice between&nbsp;two alternatives, individuals generally focus on the difference in the costs and benefits</div><div>between alternatives.</div>

<div>Marginal decisions may involve large or small&nbsp;changes. The “one more unit” could be a new factory or a new stapler. It is marginal</div><div>because it involves _ and _</div>	additional costs and benefits	
What is the differnece between average cost vs marginal cost	Average cost == total cost of production / number of cars outputted<div>- total cost of production includes one time costs such as R/D</div><div><br /></div><div>Marginal cost == cost of producing additional units with additional resource</div><div>-average cost of producing a car may be 25k, but marginal cost will be ~10k</div>	
<div>When we confront a decision, the marginal benefit and marginal cost associated with&nbsp;the choice will determine our decision.</div><div>This is an example of rule _</div>	4	
Rule 5	<div>5. ALTHOUGH INFORMATION CAN HELP US MAKE BETTER CHOICES, ITS</div><div>ACQUISITION IS COSTLY.</div>	
the time needed to gather information is scarce, making it costly to acquire.<div>This is rule _</div>	5	
<div>The process is similar when individuals search for a restaurant, a new car, or a roommate.</div><div>They will seek to acquire some information, but at some point, they will decide that the</div><div>expected benefit derived from gathering still more information is simply not worth the cost.</div><div><br /></div><div>This is rule _</div>	5	
Rule 6	<div>6. BEWARE OF THE SECONDARY EFFECTS: ECONOMIC ACTIONS OFTEN GENERATE</div><div>INDIRECT AS WELL AS DIRECT EFFECTS.</div>

What is scientific thinking?	Scientific thinking Developing a theory from basic principles and testing it against events in the real world.&nbsp;<div><br /></div><div>Good theories are consistent with and help explain real-world events.
